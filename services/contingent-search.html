                        <h3>What is contingent executive search?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Contingent executive search is a recruitment approach where payment is made only upon
                                successful placement of a candidate. This flexible model provides access to our
                                extensive talent network and rigorous candidate assessment process with a
                                performance-based fee structure. It's ideal for organizations seeking quality executive
                                talent without the commitment of a retained search arrangement.</p>

                        <h3>How does contingent search differ from retained search?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Contingent search offers payment only upon successful placement, providing flexibility
                                and reduced upfront commitment. It typically focuses on active job seekers and mid-level
                                positions with faster timelines. Retained search involves an exclusive partnership with
                                upfront fees, comprehensive market mapping of passive candidates, and is generally used
                                for senior executive roles requiring in-depth assessment.</p>

                            <p>Contingent search is ideal for mid-level management positions, specialized technical
                                roles, time-sensitive placements, non-confidential searches, and scenarios where
                                multiple hiring options need to be evaluated. It provides excellent flexibility while
                                still maintaining professional quality standards.</p>

                            <p>Contingent search typically delivers candidates within 2-4 weeks, with many initial
                                profiles presented within the first 10 business days. The timeline depends on the role's
                                specificity, location, and market conditions. Our process balances speed with thorough
                                assessment to ensure quality matches despite the accelerated timeframe.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Despite the contingent model's emphasis on speed, we maintain quality through structured
                                interviews, technical assessments, reference verification, and cultural fit evaluation.
                                Every candidate undergoes a standardized screening process to ensure they meet essential
                                requirements before presentation to clients.</p>

                            <p>Yes, the contingent model allows for engagement with multiple search partners
                                simultaneously. However, we find the most successful placements occur when clients
                                provide detailed feedback and maintain open communication with their contingent
                                partners, enabling more targeted candidate sourcing.</p>
